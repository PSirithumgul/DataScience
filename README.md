I created three Python files—encoding2.py, encoding4.py, and encoding5.py—to provide examples of encoding techniques for categorical variables. 
Alongside these files, I wrote a blog on Medium to clearly explain these techniques, including one-hot encoding and label encoding. 
The Python files, hosted in this GitHub project, were used in the blog to demonstrate the implementation of these techniques, providing readers with a clear understanding of 
how to apply them in practice.
